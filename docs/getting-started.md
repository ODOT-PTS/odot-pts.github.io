# Getting Started

1. Review the [GTFS-ride specification](http://spec.gtfsride.org) to see the full list of files and fields.
2. Take a look at [GTFS-ride example files](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/GTFS-ride/tree/master/spec/en/examples) to see what GTFS with GTFS-ride data looks like.
3. Determine which [GTFS-ride files](/docs/files) your are needed for agency's ridership data.
4. Optionally, use the [node-gtfs-ride](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/node-gtfs-ride) tool to convert Automated Passenger Counter (APC) data into GTFS-ride board-alight data.
5. Create your GTFS-ride feed.
6. Use the [GTFS-ride Feed Validator](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/gtfs-ride-validator) to test your feed.
7. Publish your validated GTFS-ride feed and use the [Ridership App](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/ridership-app) to visualize your agency's ridership data.
