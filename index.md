GTFS-ride is an open, fixed-route transit ridership data standard developed through a partnership between the Oregon Department of Transportation and Oregon State University. GTFS-ride allows for improved ridership data collection, storing, sharing, reporting, and analysis.

This standard uses the _required_ elements of GTFS and adds files necessary for ridership data standardization and reporting. GTFS-ride allows transit agencies to share their ridership data with other agencies and organizations interesting in collecting and analyzing ridership data.
